%%site.name%% is a **microblogging service**. Users post short (%%site.textlimit%%
character) notices which are broadcast to their friends and fans using
the Web, RSS, or instant messages.

If you'd like to try it out, first [register](%%action.register%%) a new account.
Then, on the [public timeline](%%action.public%%), enter your message into
the textbox at the top of the page, and click "Send". It will go out on the
public timeline and to anyone who is subscribed to your notices (probably nobody,
at first).

To subscribe to other people's notifications, go to their profile page
and click the "subscribe" button. They'll get a notice that you're now
subscribed to their notifications, and, who knows?, they might subscribe
back.
