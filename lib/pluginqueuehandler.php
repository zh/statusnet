/**
 * Queue handler for letting plugins handle stuff.
 *
 * The plugin queue handler accepts notices over the "plugin" queue
 * and simply passes them through the "HandleQueuedNotice" event.
 *
 * This gives plugins a chance to do background processing without
 * actually registering their own queue and ensuring that things
 * are queued into it.
 *
 * Fancier plugins may wish to instead hook the 'GetQueueHandlerClass'
 * event with their own class, in which case they must ensure that
 * their notices get enqueued when they need them.
